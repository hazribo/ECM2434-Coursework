            <p>
                Our project is in line with the University Of Exeter goals for increasing sustainability on campus.
                Specifically,
            </p> 
                <li>- Helping the university achieve carbon net zero by 2030</li>
                <li>- Encouraging users to act in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals</li>
                <li>- Encouraging users to visit parts of campus that promote biodiversity</li>
        </div>

            <h2 class="text-success text-center">Achieving Carbon Net Zero</h2>
            <p>
                As students and staff using the University campus, we contribute to its carbon emissions, specifically
                for scope 3 emissions (carbon emissions created by users of the campus). While the university works to reduce
                scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (carbon emissions created by the university and its partnerships), we must help
                reduce our own emissions as our part of preventing climate change. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                The best way we can reduce our carbon emissions is by reducing our carbon footprint. By engaging with our
                Green Beans project, missions are designed so that you slowly reduce your emissions simply by participating
                with the game and levelling up your pet. We also encourage users to use the WWF's carbon footprint calculator
                to gain additional advice, and watch as your footprint is reduced by engaging with your Bean Pet!

            <h2 class="text-success text-center">Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's)</h2>
            <p>
                The University Of Exeter is currently ranked 12th globally among universities on the United Nations
                SDG13 ranking for climate change mitigation, making it the highest ranked university in the United 
                Kingdom as of 2024. This highlights its status as an important and vital participant in reducing
                the effects of climate change globally. Additionaly, it is also ranked among universities as:
            </p> 
                <li>üíß 1st Globally for SDG6 (Clean water sustainability)</li>
                <li>üçé Joint 7th Globally for SDG12 (Sustainable food production and consumption)</li>
                <li>üêü 6th Globally for SDG14 (Protection of underwater life)</li>
                <li>üêª 25th Globally for SDG15 (Protection of life on land)</li>
            <p>
                The University has shown that is at the forefront of sustainability worldwide, and therefore it is 
                important as students and staff member using the campus and resources that we are aware of and help 
                contribute to these goals. Our project encourages this as we encourage users to engage in sustainable
                behaviour while on campus, such as recycling, using reusuable products and walking instead of driving.
                This helps the univeristy keep in line with matching the Sustainable Development Goals and can even help
                them rank higher and higher.

            <h2 class="text-success text-center">Visiting Sustainable Areas On Campus</h2>
            <p>
                Our project uses location tracking to create missions where users will visit areas on campus, in 
                order to encourage users to visit certain areas on campus that they may not know about. The University
                campus contains many biodiverse and sustainable areas that students and staff can engage with which will
                not only the university achieve their goals, but allow users to see some beautiful nature!
            </p> 
            <p>
                One part of campus we hope to help people discover is the various trails that people can follow
                throughout campus that are designed to show off the biodiversity of the campus! We recommend:
            </p>
                <li style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/about/gardens/visiting/treetrails/">üå≥Campus Tree Trails</a></li>
                <li style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/about/gardens/visiting/biodiversitytrails/">üå∑Campus Biodiversity Trail</a></li>
                <li style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/about/sustainability/whatwearedoing/biodiversity/soundtrail/">üéµ Streatham Campus Sound Trail</a></li>
            <p>
                Another location we encourage users to visit is the Exeter community garden. Many people may not be aware of this
                area but it is an important area in which the university promotes and engages in sustainable practices.
                We hope that some users who visit end up being inspired and becoming members!
